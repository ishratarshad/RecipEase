## Project Description

RecipEase is a personalized recipe recommendation website for individuals with dietary restrictions, allergies, or food preferences. Users simply input their needs, and RecipEase returns a curated list of recipes tailored to their lifestyle. Each recipe includes:

- Ingredient list
- Preparation steps
- Step-by-step instructional videos (if available)

The goal is to make cooking safe, enjoyable, and stress-free — one plate at a time.

## Motivation

Finding meals that align with allergies or dietary restrictions can be overwhelming. We've experienced the frustration of scrolling endlessly, checking ingredients, and still feeling unsure. RecipEase is built to take that stress away — helping users find meals that match their needs while offering peace of mind.
