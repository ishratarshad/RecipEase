## Project Description:

RecipEase is a personalized recipe recommendation website for individuals with dietary restrictions, allergies, or food preferences. Users simply input their needs, and RecipEase returns a curated list of recipes tailored to their lifestyle. Each recipe includes:

- Ingredient list
- Preparation steps
- Step-by-step instructional videos (if available)

The goal is to make cooking safe, enjoyable, and stress-free— one plate at a time!

## Motivation:

Finding meals that align with allergies or dietary restrictions can be overwhelming. We've experienced the frustration of scrolling endlessly, checking ingredients, and still feeling unsure. RecipEase is built to take that stress away— helping users find meals that match their needs while offering peace of mind.

## How to Run Locally:

## 1. Clone the GitHub repository:

Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell for Windows, Terminal app for macOS) and run:

  git clone https://github.com/ishratarshad/RecipEase.git
  
  cd RecipEase/client

## 2. Install Node.js and npm

Windows: Download and install from https://nodejs.org/en/download

macOS: Use the same link

Or, if you use Homebrew: brew install node

### To verify it is installed:
  
  node -v
  
  npm -v

## 3. Install project dependencies
Make sure you are in the RecipEase folder

Run: cd client, then npm install

## 4. Create a .env file

Make sure you are in the client folder now



This key allows the app to fetch recipes from Spoonacular.

## 6. Start the React app

### Once the key is set up:

  Run: npm start
  
This will open the app in your browser at: http://localhost:3000

### If you get an error  “running scripts is disabled,” run this once in PowerShell (make sure you run Powershell as administrator):

  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
 
Then run:  npm start
